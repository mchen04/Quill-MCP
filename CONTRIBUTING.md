##  Getting Started

### Development Environment Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/quill-mcp.git
   cd quill-mcp
   ```

2. **Set up development environment**
   ```bash
   # Using uv (recommended)
   uv sync --dev
   
   # Or using pip
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

3. **Run tests to verify setup**
   ```bash
   uv run pytest
   # or
   pytest
   ```

4. **Run the server locally**
   ```bash
   uv run python -m quill_mcp.server --debug
   ```

### Code Quality Tools

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Format code
uv run ruff format .

# Lint code
uv run ruff check .

# Type checking
uv run mypy src/quill_mcp/

# Run all quality checks
uv run pytest && uv run ruff check . && uv run mypy src/quill_mcp/
```

##  Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes
- Keep functions focused and small (< 50 lines when possible)

### Database Changes
- Always use migrations for schema changes
- Test with existing data to ensure backward compatibility
- Update both the schema and any related triggers
- Document any breaking changes

### MCP Protocol
- Follow the official MCP specification
- Use FastMCP patterns for consistency
- Ensure all tools return proper error messages
- Test resources, tools, and prompts thoroughly

### Testing
- Write tests for all new features
- Include both unit and integration tests
- Test database operations with real SQLite
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

##  Adding New Features

### Adding a New Tool

1. **Define the tool logic** in `src/quill_mcp/tools/`
2. **Add database operations** if needed in `database.py`
3. **Register the tool** in `server.py`
4. **Write tests** for the tool functionality
5. **Update documentation** with examples

Example tool structure:
```python
@self.mcp.tool()
def my_new_tool(param1: str, param2: int = 0) -> str:
    """Brief description of what the tool does.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of parameter
        param2: Optional parameter with default
    """
    try:
        # Tool implementation
        result = do_something(param1, param2)
        return f"‚úÖ Success: {result}"
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Tool error: {e}")
        return f"‚ùå Error: {str(e)}"
```

### Adding a New Resource

1. **Define the resource** in `server.py`
2. **Add database queries** if needed
3. **Format as JSON** for MCP consumption
4. **Test with Claude Code**

### Adding Writing Prompts

1. **Create prompt function** in `server.py`
2. **Use clear argument descriptions**
3. **Return structured messages**
4. **Test with actual writing scenarios**

##  Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
uv run pytest

# Run specific test file
uv run pytest tests/test_database.py

# Run with coverage
uv run pytest --cov=quill_mcp

# Run integration tests
uv run pytest tests/integration/
```

### Test Structure

- `tests/unit/` - Unit tests for individual components
- `tests/integration/` - Integration tests with real database
- `tests/fixtures/` - Test data and fixtures
- `tests/conftest.py` - Shared test configuration

### Writing Tests

```python
import pytest
from quill_mcp.database import QuillDatabase

def test_add_character():
    """Test adding a character to a project."""
    db = QuillDatabase(":memory:")  # Use in-memory DB for tests
    
    # Create test project
    project_id = db.create_project("Test Project")
    
    # Add character
    char_id = db.add_character(
        project_id, 
        "Test Character", 
        description="A test character"
    )
    
    # Verify character was added
    characters = db.get_characters(project_id)
    assert len(characters) == 1
    assert characters[0]["name"] == "Test Character"
```
