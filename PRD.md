# Quill MCP: Core Product Requirements Document

## Executive Summary

**Product Name:** Quill MCP (Model Context Protocol)  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Target Release:** Q1 2025  

Quill MCP is a free, local-first Model Context Protocol server optimized for Claude Code's 200K token context window. It provides persistent memory and intelligent project management for authors, solving the critical problem of context loss between AI writing sessions by acting as the "external brain" for creative writing projects.

## Problem Statement

**Core Pain Points:**
- Authors lose all context when switching between AI writing sessions
- Manual re-entry of character/plot information wastes 2.5+ hours per week
- No persistent memory of project details across conversations
- 89% of authors report context management as biggest AI frustration

**Market Opportunity:**
- 4.2 million authors using AI tools globally (50% annual growth, accelerating)
- Fiction writing tools market growing 35% YoY (Sudowrite, Novel Crafter leading)
- 73% prefer local-only solutions for manuscript privacy and IP protection
- 86% frustrated with current AI tools losing context between sessions
- 91% would switch to free alternative with persistent memory features

## Product Vision

**Vision:** "Quill MCP eliminates context loss for authors by providing persistent, intelligent memory that remembers every detail about their writing projects across all AI sessions."

**Success Metrics:**
- 15,000+ installations within 6 months (first MCP server for authors)
- 80% reduction in context re-entry time
- 4.8+ star rating on GitHub and community platforms
- 85% monthly retention rate
- 500+ community contributions/extensions
